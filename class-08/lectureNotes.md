- previously we moostly had float
  - pros: lets us move things out of flow
  - cons: not super precise, it can mess up other things on your page, that you then have to fix and put back in flow
- positioning with absolute relative
  - cons: a bit involved
  - pro: allows you to visually place items on top of other items

- new options
  - flexbox
