# what is a data type
- a type of data
- a way of formating data that the computer can understand and make assumptions about

Javascript is a *loosely* typed *dynamic* language!
- we do not have to define a data type when declaring a variable 
- I can change datatypes AFTER I declare it: the type can change after it has been initially defined

## Primitive Data Types
a primitive data type is one that can not be broken down into something more basic 

- number
  - in JS number is THE numeric datatype, can be negative numbers and decimals

- boolean
  - logical datatype : true / false

- string
  - a sequence of characters enclosed ' '

- undefined
  - a primitive value assigned to variables when no value is assigned

- null
  - an explicitly defined value that means none/nothing
